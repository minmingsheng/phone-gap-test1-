                    <span class='bold'>Ragdolls</span> are listed amongst the younger siblings of the cat family. <span class="highlight">These cats were developed by Ann Baker in 1960s in California.</span> The founding longhaired domestic cat was called Josephine and had white coat but had genes for other patterns too due to its unknown ancestry. For her breeding program, Baker selected large, placid cats from her neighborhood that particularly displayed the Himalayan pattern or were pointed like the Siamese cats. <span class="highlight">The resulting cat was called Ragdoll as it flopped happily in the arms of people.</span> Later on, other cat breeds such as Burmese, Birmans and Persians were also added to the flock. Ragdolls are not outcrossed to any other breed.

                                <img src="img/portrait.png" alt="portrait"> <span>F</span>rom the very beginning, my friend gave me a kitten. Since then, it's been almost seven years. Yeah, that is right, my pet "Tina", has been more than 7 years old. Now, I'm still crazy about cat. Just by chance, I started to know Ragdoll that is pure breed cat. They look so fancy so that I even can't stop love them. Each of them just looks like a pretty girl! From then on, I commenced to raise them, which give me a lot of fun. Just someday, one idea occurred me that why don't I breed them, which become my pat-time job. That would be enjoyable for me. Then me and my girl friend have our own kitty couple, Dora and Emon. Why we name like this? Doraemon is a robot cat in Japanese comic, which is very cute and magic, he can make your dream come true. Bunch of people, when they were a little boy or girl, were eager to own one Doraemon. On the other hand, its pronunciation similar to 'dream', so Doraemon is dream per se. As a result, we decided to name our cattery as Doraemonery Cattery, which has already been registered in TICA. Hopefully, we will got the first litter of kitten on next fall. Anyway we just start and hope to get more people to support. If we get something wrong or inappropriate in this industry please let me know. Let's make the cat world more fantastic.
